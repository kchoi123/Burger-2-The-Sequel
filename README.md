# Burger-2-The-Sequel

### Deployed site: 

### This app is the same as the Burger app but with implementing sequelize - replacing ORM, object-relational mapping. This small project was very interesting to better understand ORM and how sequelize makes the app more secure and stable. 

* Application Details: 
    - Eat a burger and regurgitate your burger to eat it again!
    - Eat Me!
    - Regurgitate
    - Add a new burger to eat

* Technology Used: 
    - node
    - express 
    - mysql2
    - sequelize
